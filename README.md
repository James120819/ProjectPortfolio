# ProjectPortfolio / Airgead Banking
This is a C++ program that formulates investment banking and is built with OOP

# 1. This project is a C++ program that focuses on built in application functions for user banking and investments through the company Airgead Banking. The intention of this program is to allow consumers to observe their investments and have an understanding of their accounts. 

# 2. Something I utilized throughout this project that I am proud of was the organization of the classes that were created and included. These separated classes were used to support their specified functionality actions to meet requirements as well. I had also used OOP programming as well throughout this assingment. 

# 3. Something I could have improved on to enhance the quality of this project would be validating the input. An error that I had made in this project was not validating the input. Validating the input when builting programs would be crucial for me to enhance my codes performance of accuracy and functionality improvements. 

# 4. The area of this project that I had the most challenge with was making sure that I had organized the classes correctly and applying logic principles. This was a challenege for me because I was having a hard time understanding OOP and ways to apply it to my program. I also had a challenge with running tests for the program since I was trying to understand how to apply the formula for interest compound. A way I was able to improve on this challenge was reviewing code examples of how OOP is handled and applied throughout the creation of these programs. It also helped breaking the information down into small areas to have a better understanding as well. 

# 5. This program helped me have a better understanding of organizing different classes to work on seperate parts of the system and including in-line comments to have descriptive code files that are readable. I will be able to apply these practices into creating more advanced software projects, learning more enhanced ways of advacing those skills, and using them to help build functional programs externally. 

# 6. I used in-line comments to help identify what was being done throughout the program. I also had used specified names to help maintain the readability of my code. This helped my code remain clean and readable.

# Contact Service Java Project 

# 1. To ensure my program is functional and secure, I would implement validation input practices along with vulnerability assesments. Continuous testing also would help allowing my program to be more functional and secure. 

# 2. It's important to always consider how the way the consumer will interact with the product. User needs would be met by validating and putting their stories at the highest level of priority along with keeping communication consistent. I believe its important to always keep communication at the highest standards along with making sure user needs are met. 

# 3. My software development approach involves analyzing user needs and then formulating a blueprint plan before implementing the design phase of the software product. It's important to always remain consistent throughout the process.

# Artemis Financial Project Two 

# 1. Artemis Financial is a investment firm company that focuses on consumer investments and banking. While the company is trusted amoungst consumers, the company has faced challenges. Issues were presented due to lack of communication and collaboration within their software practices. There was also a lack of validation and verification when working with their programs. The goal in regard to working with this company was to utilize HTTPS implementation, encryption, etc to best meet the standards for the improved systems. 

# 2. Something I did well throughout this project was identifying vulnerabilities that were affecting the program. Having an understanding of vulnerabilities that have an impact on the software program is important for avoiding these errors and knowing how to handle them. Hash functions were also used throughout this program to help ensure file verification as well. 

# 3. The hardest part during the process of working on this project involved working with certificates. I did not have an understanding of the way certificates were implemented throughout software development. An advantage of this was that it allowed me to have a better understanding of realistic hands on applications and encryptions as well. 

# 4. I used HTTPS to help ensure better security throughout my program. HTTPS is crucial for providing security practices of data sensitivity and making sure consumer information is protected. Within the future I'd like to use OWASP to help identify vulnerability issues and user errors. 

# 5. I had ran a few test throughout the project to ensure functionality. The purpose of this was to consistently have an awareness of how the program is running while I am making changes. In software development when we're creating programs, while updates are important, they still can cause bug crashes and frequent errors if not utilized well. 

# 6. I used input validation and SHA-256 hashings. Using these tools allowed me to continuously run tests to analyze functionality and also ensuring data security protection. 

# 7. The significance of working on this project was that it allowed me to have an understanding of the crucial tools that are needed within software development in order to provide high quality products. It also allowed me to identify vulnerabilities easier with an understanding of how they cause impacts onto software systems.
