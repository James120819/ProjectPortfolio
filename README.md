# ProjectPortfolio / Airgead Banking
This is a C++ program that formulates investment banking and is built with OOP

# 1. This project is a C++ program that focuses on built in application functions for user banking and investments through the company Airgead Banking. The intention of this program is to allow consumers to observe their investments and have an understanding of their accounts. 

# 2. Something I utilized throughout this project that I am proud of was the organization of the classes that were created and included. These separated classes were used to support their specified functionality actions to meet requirements as well. I had also used OOP programming as well throughout this assingment. 

# 3. Something I could have improved on to enhance the quality of this project would be validating the input. An error that I had made in this project was not validating the input. Validating the input when builting programs would be crucial for me to enhance my codes performance of accuracy and functionality improvements. 

# 4. The area of this project that I had the most challenge with was making sure that I had organized the classes correctly and applying logic principles. This was a challenege for me because I was having a hard time understanding OOP and ways to apply it to my program. I also had a challenge with running tests for the program since I was trying to understand how to apply the formula for interest compound. A way I was able to improve on this challenge was reviewing code examples of how OOP is handled and applied throughout the creation of these programs. It also helped breaking the information down into small areas to have a better understanding as well. 

# 5. This program helped me have a better understanding of organizing different classes to work on seperate parts of the system and including in-line comments to have descriptive code files that are readable. I will be able to apply these practices into creating more advanced software projects, learning more enhanced ways of advacing those skills, and using them to help build functional programs externally. 

# 6. I used in-line comments to help identify what was being done throughout the program. I also had used specified names to help maintain the readability of my code. This helped my code remain clean and readable.

# 1. To ensure my program is functional and secure, I would implement validation input practices along with vulnerability assesments. Continuous testing also would help allowing my program to be more functional and secure. 

# 2. It's important to always consider how the way the consumer will interact with the product. User needs would be met by validating and putting their stories at the highest level of priority along with keeping communication consistent. I believe its important to always keep communication at the highest standards along with making sure user needs are met. 

# 3. My software development approach involves analyzing user needs and then formulating a blueprint plan before implementing the design phase of the software product. It's important to always remain consistent throughout the process.
